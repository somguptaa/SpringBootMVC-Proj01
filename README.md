## What I Learned from This Spring Boot MVC Project

This project helped me understand of **Spring Boot** and **Spring MVC** by building a simple web application using **JSP**.

### Key Learnings

- Created and ran a Spring Boot application
- Understood MVC architecture (Controller, Service, View)
- Learned how controllers handle URLs and return JSP pages
- Used JSP to display content in the browser
- Learned why JSP files are placed inside `WEB-INF`
- Connected Controller → Service → View flow
- Passed data from controller to JSP using `Model`
- Understood embedded Tomcat in Spring Boot
- Learned to read Spring Boot startup logs
- Navigated between pages using links

### Simple Understanding

- **FrontController(DispatcherServlet)** entry and exit point of all requests
- **Controller** handles user requests  
- **Service** contains business logic  
- **JSP** displays output to the user  

This project gave me confidence in building a basic **Spring Boot MVC** application and understanding the web request flow.
